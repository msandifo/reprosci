##  Norway v Australia - structural budget balances

Norway and Australia are both major exporters of fossil fuels. Since the early 90's Australian fossil energy exports have increased `r paste0(signif(perc.increases[1,2], 2), "%")`  on a total energy  content basis,  whereas Norway has increased by `r paste0(signif(perc.increases[2,2], 2), "%")`. Despite this, the structural budget balances of the two countries have diverged dramatically, in favour of Norway. Factors include 

* rather different commodity mixes (more oil and gas in Norway, more coal in Australia which increasingly relies on net oil imports) and, more importantly, 

* very different petroleum/mineral royalty and taxation regimes (see [Paul Cleary's _Trillion dollar baby_, BlackInc Books, 2016](https://www.blackincbooks.com.au/books/trillion-dollar-baby)).

The analysis here uses open-sourced data (from IMF and BP) to illustrate how  energy exports and government financial balances have evolved in both countries. Key points:

* Despite the  `r paste0(signif(perc.increases[1,2], 2), "%")` increase in fossil fuel exports (in energy equivalent terms)  since 1990, Australia  has accrued very significant structural deficit accumulating an interest bill of around US$12 billion per year.

The last sequence of images,  somewhat off topic, is relevant to the Australian political narratives concerning budget repair.

## Data Sources


* [BP statistical-review of energy, 2018 edition](https://www.bp.com/content/dam/bp/en/corporate/excel/energy-economics/statistical-review/bp-stats-review-2018-all-data.xlsx). The BP data is distributed as an Excel spreadsheet. Here I use the  fossil fuel production and consumption data, aggregated in energy equivalent  ```mtoe``` terms (million tonnes oil-equivalent).

* [IMF world energy outlook](https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2018/01/weodata/WEOApr2018all.xls). The IMF WEO is distributed as an Excel spreadsheet. Here I use the population data (LP, reported in millions) and, as a measure of government revenue and expenditure (```GGXCNL``` and ```GGXONLB```),  reported in billions in local currency terms. The values are converted to US$ using ```NGDPDPC``` and ```NGDPPC```. interest is calculated as ```GGXONLB-GGXONLB``` where
  + ```GGXONLB``` Primary net lending/borrowing is net lending (+)/borrowing (?) plus net interest payable/paid (interest expense minus interest revenue).
  + ```GGXCNL``` Net lending (+)/ borrowing (?) is calculated as revenue minus total expenditure. This is a core GFS balance that measures the extent to which general government is either putting financial resources at the disposal of other sectors in the economy and nonresidents (net lending), or utilizing the financial resources generated by other sectors and nonresidents (net borrowing). This balance may be viewed as an indicator of the financial impact of general government activity on the rest of the economy and nonresidents (GFSM 2001, paragraph 4.17). Note: Net lending (+)/borrowing (?) is also equal to net acquisition of financial assets minus net incurrence of liabilities.

##  Caveats


## Code

The code base is in ```r``` and is managed  within RStudio, using  the  ```drake```  package, and my ```reoproscir``` package on ```github```  obtained with ```devtools::install_github('msandifo/reproscir')```. _Note this package is very much a  work in progress, and while it  is installed automagically,it will likely need reinstalling with _```devtools::install_github('msandifo/reproscir')```.

The code can be executed by opening the ```Rstudio``` project  ```005.Rproj```
and sourcing ```drake.R```.

```{r echo=T, eval=F}
source('drake.R')
```
Details of the steps invoked by ```drake.R` are summarised below.

* `source('./src/packages.R')` checks for and automatically installs missing package dependencies
<!-- ```tidyverse```, ```ggplot2```, ```magrittr```, ```purrr```, ```stringr```, ```drake```, ```lubridate```, ```rvest```, ```rappdirs```,```data.table```, ```fasttime```, ```devtools```, ```wbstats```  -->
<!--  from cran, and ```hrbrthemes```  and ```reproscir``` from the github repos ```hrbrmstr/hrbrthemes``` and ```msandifo/reproscir``` -->

* `source('./src/settings.R')` sets variables, such as the ```drake.path```,
* `source('./src/functions.R')` reads in data processing functions not in ```reproscir```
* `source('./src/theme.R')`  sets the ggplot theme derived from ```hrbrthemes```
* `source('./src/plots.R')` plot functions
* `source('./src/downloads.R')` directs the download of the  relevant data files to a local directory set by
``` local.path```. By default ``` local.path=NULL``` in which case data is downloaded via ```rappdirs::user_cache_dir()``` to a folder in the users cache directory (for macOSX, ```~/Library/cache```).


* `source('./src/plan.R')` defines the drake plan ```reproplan```
with the dependency structure
```{r drake_plan, echo=TRUE, cache=F}
source('./src/settings.R')
source('./src/theme.R')
source('./src/functions.R')
source('./src/plots.R')
source('./src/plan.R')
drake::make( reproplan )
config <- drake::drake_config(reproplan)
graph <- drake::drake_graph_info(config, group = 'status', clusters = 'imported')
drake::render_drake_graph(graph, file='figs/rmd_render_drake.png')
```

<img src='./figs/rmd_render_drake.png' alt='hist1' align='center' style = 'border: none; float: center;' width = '1000px'>

Note that ```reproplan``` processes the files downloaded  by ```./src/downloads.R```, returning ```merged.data```
```{r  cache=FALSE}
print(head(readd(merged.data)))

```

* ```source(drake::make( reproplan ))```

* ```source('./src/ouputs.R')```
output charts  to the ```./figs``` directory :

```{r  echo=TRUE, cache=TRUE, eval=F}
p005<-drake::readd(p005)

## On Australian government "Budget Repair"  
   
 "Budget repair" is part  of the  Coalition's narrative as it prepares for re-election in 2019.  These figures provide some background.
   Note the budget balances are expressed here in Australian dollar terms, rather than US dollars (as for the previous figures).
