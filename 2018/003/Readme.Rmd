##  East Coast gas market supply balance and NEM prices

Amongst the many factors that caused Australian east coast electricity wholesale prices to double in 2016 was the opening of the east coast gas market to internatinal LNG exports, via the Port of Gladstone.  With gas production  supporting LNG export derived from the Coal Seam Gas (CSG) fields in the Roma production zone in  QLD, there have been consequences for the supply mix into the domestic market.
Here I explore  time series for Gladstone Port Authority LNG export volumes, east coast production volumes, and  NEM market prices.

Gas production  is in TJ/day and NEM prices in AUD$.

I know of no public data relevant to the proportion of production used in  LNG compression and liquefaction and associated CSG activities.     I assume a value of 12% for the parastitc load, which can be changed via the  ```drake.R``` file.

```parasitic.load=12```
 

## Data Sources

* East coast gas market  production data is derived from AEMO's now archived [Gas Services Bulletin Board actual flows](https://www.aemo.com.au/Gas/Gas-Bulletin-Board)

* LNG export data are sourced from the [Gladstone Port Authority (GPA)  website](http://content1.gpcl.com.au/viewcontent/CargoComparisonsSelection/CargoComparisonsSelection.aspx)

* NEM demand are sourced from AEMO's half hourly price and demand csv files.

##  Caveats

This repo contains a preprocessed dataset ```./data/facility.Rdata```, containing   GASBB facility data. Due to an uprgading of AEMO's GASBB data reprository this not - at the time of preparation - straightforward to reproduce from the raw data. The ```gasbb.facility``` data.frame contains  the following info 

`r load("./data/facility.Rdata"); names(gasbb.facility)`

with ```gasbb.facility$PlantType``` used to select the production, as opposed to pipelines and storage, facilities needed  to  extract a supply balance from AEMO's  archived [Gas Services Bulletin Board actual flows](https://www.aemo.com.au/Gas/Gas-Bulletin-Board) data.


## Code

The code base is in ```r``` and is best managed with in managed within RStudio, using   the ```drake``` package.

#### Package dependencies

If not already installed, sourcing ```'./src/functions.R'``` automatically installs the package dependencies 
```tidyverse```, ```ggplot2```, ```magrittr```, ```purrr```, ```stringr```, ```drake```, ```lubridate```, ```rvest```, ```rappdirs```,```data.table```, ```fasttime```, ```devtools```, ```wbstats``` , ```zoo```
 from cran, and ```hrbrthemes``` from the github repos ```hrbrmstr/hrbrthemes``` and ```msandifo/reproscir```



#### Setup

To start we  set some variables, such as the ```drake.path```, read in key functions (including the drake plan ```reproplan```) and adjust the ggplot theme.

```{r echo=T, eval=F}
source('./src/settings.R')
source('./src/theme.R')
source('./src/functions.R')
source('./src/plan.R')
source('./src/plots.R')
 
``` 

#### Downloads
 
```{r echo=T, eval=F} 
source('./src/downloads.R')
``` 

directs the downlaod of the  AEMO csv data files to be downloaded  into the local directory set by 
``` local.path```
By default ``` local.path=NULL``` in which case data is downloaded via ```rappdirs::user_cache_dir()``` to a folder in the users cache directory (for macOSX, ```~/Library/cache```) to ```file.path(local.path, aemo)```.  ```'./src/downloads.R'```  is a wrapper on the function calls

```{r echo=T, eval=F}
reproscir::download_aemo_aggregated(year=2007:2018, months=1:12, local.path=local.path)
```
AEMO GASBB data set is downlaoded, read 
```{r echo=T, eval=F}
gasbb <- reproscir::download_gasbb() %>%  
    reproscir::read_gasbb( ) 

```

and  then mutated  and joined with theLNG data (see ```./src/dowwnloads.R```)

#### Drake plan

The code is organised and run/update via drake plan ```reproplan``` ( sourced via ```source('./src/plan.R')```)

```{r echo=T, eval=F}
drake::make( reproplan, force=T)
```

The ```reproplan``` dependency structure
```{r drake_plan, echo=TRUE, cache=T}
config <- drake::drake_config(reproplan)
graph <- drake::drake_graph_info(config, group = "status", clusters = "imported")
drake::render_drake_graph(graph, file="figs/rmd_render_drake.png")
```

<img src="./figs/rmd_render_drake.png" alt="hist1" align="center" style = "border: none; float: center;" width = "1000px">


Note that ```reproplan``` loads the ```./data/data.Rdata``` built by ```./src/downloads.R```, returning ```Nem.month```

```{r  cache=FALSE}
print(head(readd(NEM.month)))

```

and ```gasbb.prod.zone.month````

 ```{r  cache=FALSE}
print(head(readd(gasbb.prod.zone.month)))

```

where ```gasbb.prod.zone.month$lng``` is the component of ```Roma``` prodcution directed towards Gladstone LNG exports, assuming a  12% parasitic load applies (i.e. the gas used for LNG transport and compression,  CSG produced  water treatments etc. )

 




#### Output

Output charts using ```ggplot``` are saved to the ```./figs``` directory :

```{r  echo=TRUE, cache=TRUE, eval=F}
p003<-drake::readd(p003)
ggsave("./figs/p003_01.png",  p003$p1 ,width=8, height=5) 
 ```
<img src="./figs/p003_01.png" alt="hist1" align="center" style = "border: none; float: center;" width = "1000px">

 
## Code details

### Gladstone Port Authority (GPA)

The function call

``` read_gladstone_ports(year=NULL, month=NULL,fuel="Liquefied Natural Gas", country="Total")```

scrapes data from the GPA html tables, utilising the package ```rvest```, noting that other commodities exported through the GPA, such as ```"Coal"```, can also be specified.
The function call

read_gladstone_ports<- function(year=NULL, month=NULL,fuel="Liquefied Natural Gas", country="Total")

scrapes data from the GPA html tables, utilising the package rvest, noting that other commodities exported through the GPA, such as "Coal", can also be specified.

The drake plan indirectly calls ```read_gladstone_ports``` via ```update_gladstone```

#### NEM data

While the monthly NEM csv files have time stamps ```SETTLEMENTDATE``` ordered ```ymd hms```, the September 2016 csv files have time stamps reversed ```dmy hms```. The function ```dmy_to_ymd``` reorders the time stamps to ```ymd hms```.
