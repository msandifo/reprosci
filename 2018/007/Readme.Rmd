##  The methane enigma

Since 2006, atmospheric methane levels have been rising alarmingly. This follows a significant pause in growth from 2000-2005, and before that, a  period of reducing growth rates since the early 90's. 
<!-- The record from Australia's Cape Grim Observatory show the year on year growth September 2017 to September 2018 is 0.64% (cf 0.6 for CO2). This latest period of extreme growth started around February 2017. -->
<!-- `{diff(rbind( tail(  cg.ch4,13) %>% head(1),tail( cg.ch4,1) )$value)/(tail(  cg.ch4,2) %>% head(1))$value*100` 

To be added ... Some notes about global warming potential.-->

The increase in growth rates after 2006 is concerning, and has been the subject of considerable discussion in recent literature.  It coincides in time with the remarkable developments in _shale  gas_ (or _unconventinal gas_)  production in the US, which have seen a dramatic increase in US natural gas production as well as US _unconventional oil_ or _"tight" oil_ production.  For example, the recent increases in CH4 have been accompanied by a  massive increase in US gas production, up almost 10% p.a.

However, the causal relationship between the two is not at all clear. While atmospheric levels of methane have rise the isotopic ratio of the methane has trended to lighter ratios (more negative C13/C12 ratios).  Thermogenic methane produced from shale gas is istopically similar, or slighly heavier than, atmospheric. 

Noting that  correlation is not causation, this post explores changes in the correlation  between several datasets that make for further reassessment of the relationships.

Since around 2005 there is a very significant correlation between the _rate of growth_ in CH4 and US gas production. This was not the case prior to 2000.

* Most interstingly, the correlation is not with the volume of gas produced, but the rate of increase in volume, which suggests any plausible causation must associate with the way gas fields are developed.

* We might ask questions about what happens more broadly in the production cycle. For example _coal seam gas_ (CSG) production in the US has dramatically reduced  because of cost pressures from the shale gas. CSG methane is isotopically much lighter CH4 than thermogenic methane. Leakage rates from abandoned CSG/CBM fields need only be a minor proportion of fugitives from shale gas, in order to drive isotope ratios down. 


## Data Sources

*  US gas volumes form US Energy Information Agency (EIA)
* Cape Grim Observatory data from CSIRO
* US rig count data from Baker Hughes

##  Caveats

* not fuly reproducible yet as I am developing a ```data.yml``` specification in read via the ```reropscir``` package to implement the data downloads. This still needs some generics to work for others. I am working on this and it will be coming soon ...
* BakerHughes rig count data is distributed  as a binary xlsb (binary) format.  For conversion to ```.xlsz``` so it can be read via packages like ```readxl```, I use the  soffice  cli (from the libreoffice suite)


## Code

The code base is in ```r``` and is managed  within RStudio, using  the  ```drake```  package, and my ```reoproscir``` package on ```github```  obtained with ```devtools::install_github('msandifo/reproscir')```. _Note this package is very much a  work in progress, and while it  is installed automagically,it will likely need reinstalling with _```devtools::install_github('msandifo/reproscir')```.

The code can be executed by opening the ```Rstudio``` project  ```007.Rproj```
and sourcing ```drake.R```.

```{r echo=T, eval=F}
source('drake.R')
```
Details of the steps invoked by ```drake.R``` are summarised below.

* `source('./src/packages.R')` checks for and automatically installs missing package dependencies
<!-- ```tidyverse```, ```ggplot2```, ```magrittr```, ```purrr```, ```stringr```, ```drake```, ```lubridate```, ```rvest```, ```rappdirs```,```data.table```, ```fasttime```, ```devtools```, ```wbstats```  -->
<!--  from cran, and ```hrbrthemes```  and ```reproscir``` from the github repos ```hrbrmstr/hrbrthemes``` and ```msandifo/reproscir``` -->

* `source('./src/settings.R')` sets variables, such as the ```drake.path```,
* `source('./src/functions.R')` reads any functions not in ```reproscir```
* `source('./src/theme.R')`  sets a ggplot theme derived from ```hrbrthemes```
* `source('./src/plots.R')` plot functions
* `source('./src/downloads.R')` directs the download of the  relevant data files to be downloaded  into the local directory set by
``` local.path```. By default ``` local.path=NULL``` in which case data is downloaded via ```rappdirs::user_cache_dir()``` to a folder in the users cache directory (for macOSX, ```~/Library/cache```) to ```file.path(local.path, aemo)```.


* `source('./src/plan.R')` defines the drake plan ```reproplan```
* `source('./src/ouputs.R')` potsprocessing output functions

The dependency structure of the reprplan is obtained by procesing as follows
```{r drake_plan, echo=TRUE, cache=F}
source('./src/settings.R')
source('./src/theme.R')
source('./src/functions.R')
source('./src/plots.R')
source('./src/plan.R')
drake::make( reproplan )
config <- drake::drake_config(reproplan)
graph <- drake::drake_graph_info(config, group = 'status', clusters = 'imported')
drake::render_drake_graph(graph, file='figs/rmd_render_drake.png')
```

<img src='./figs/rmd_render_drake.png' alt='hist1' align='center' style = 'border: none; float: center;' width = '1000px'>

Note that ```reproplan``` processes the files downloaded  by ```./src/downloads.R```, returning ```merged.data```
```{r  cache=FALSE}
#print(head(readd(merged.data)))

```

* ```source(drake::make( reproplan ))```
* ```source('./src/ouputs.R')```
output charts  to the ```./figs``` directory :

```{r  echo=TRUE, cache=TRUE, eval=F}
p007<-drake::readd(p007)
