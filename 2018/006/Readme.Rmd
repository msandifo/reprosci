## Data Sources

*  [BP statistical-review of energy, 2018 edition](https://www.bp.com/content/dam/bp/en/corporate/excel/energy-economics/statistical-review/bp-stats-review-2018-all-data.xlsx). The BP data is distributed as an Excel spreadsheet. Here I use the  primary energy   consumption data. To obtain the sheet number (=`r  reproscir::BP_sheets(search =c("prim","consumption"))$sheet`) we apply ```sheet = reproscir::BP_sheets(search =c("prim","consumption"))$sheet``` 


##  Caveats


## Code

The code base is in ```r``` and is managed  within RStudio, using  the  ```drake```  package, and my ```reoproscir``` package on ```github```  obtained with ```devtools::install_github('msandifo/reproscir')```. _Note this package is very much a  work in progress, and while it  is installed automagically if not present, if it had been previously installed it will likely need updating with_ ```devtools::install_github('msandifo/reproscir')```.

Future energy consumption projections are implemented with the function ```reproscir::project_cagr``` (_project with compounding annual growth rate_)  which takes advantage of the wonderful functional programming capabilities of the  ```purrr``` package in the statement  ```purrr::imap_dbl(rep(1,n), ~.x*((1.+ gr/100)^.y))``` where ```n``` is the length in years of the projection and ```gr``` is the annual growth rate.[1]

The code can be executed by opening the ```Rstudio``` project  ```006.Rproj```
and sourcing ```drake.R```.

```{r echo=T, eval=F}
source('drake.R')
```
Details of the steps invoked by ```drake.R``` are summarised below.

* `source('./src/packages.R')` checks for and automatically installs missing package dependencies
<!-- ```tidyverse```, ```ggplot2```, ```magrittr```, ```purrr```, ```stringr```, ```drake```, ```lubridate```, ```rvest```, ```rappdirs```,```data.table```, ```fasttime```, ```devtools```, ```wbstats```  -->
<!--  from cran, and ```hrbrthemes```  and ```reproscir``` from the github repos ```hrbrmstr/hrbrthemes``` and ```msandifo/reproscir``` -->

* `source('./src/settings.R')` sets variables, such as the ```drake.path```,
* `source('./src/functions.R')` reads any functions not in ```reproscir```
* `source('./src/theme.R')`  sets a ggplot theme derived from ```hrbrthemes```
* `source('./src/plots.R')` plot functions
* `source('./src/downloads.R')` directs the download of the relevant data files  into a local directory set by
``` local.path```. By default ``` local.path=NULL``` in which case data is downloaded via ```rappdirs::user_cache_dir()``` to a folder in the users cache directory (for macOSX, ```~/Library/cache```) to ```file.path(local.path, aemo)```. Data files will only be downloaded if not already. 


* `source('./src/plan.R')` defines the drake plan ```reproplan```
* `source('./src/ouputs.R')` potsprocessing output functions

The dependency structure of the reprplan is obtained by procesing as follows
```{r drake_plan, echo=TRUE, cache=F}
source('./src/settings.R')
source('./src/theme.R')
source('./src/functions.R')
source('./src/plots.R')
source('./src/plan.R')
drake::make( reproplan )
config <- drake::drake_config(reproplan)
graph <- drake::drake_graph_info(config, group = 'status', clusters = 'imported')
drake::render_drake_graph(graph, file='figs/rmd_render_drake.png')
```

<img src='./figs/rmd_render_drake.png' alt='hist1' align='center' style = 'border: none; float: center;' width = '1000px'>

Note that ```reproplan``` processes the files downloaded  by ```./src/downloads.R```, returning ```merged.data```
```{r  cache=FALSE}
print(head(readd(merged.data)))

```

* ```source(drake::make( reproplan ))```
* ```source('./src/ouputs.R')```
output charts  to the ```./figs``` directory :

```{r  echo=TRUE, cache=TRUE, eval=F}
p006<-drake::readd(p006)

 ```

 <img src='./figs/p006_01.png' alt='hist1' align='center' style = 'border: none; float: center;' width = '1000px'>


## Code Notes
 [1] An alterative is using  ```haskell``` like list comprehensions  implemented in ```reposcir``` as 
 
 ```{r  echo=TRUE, cache=FALSE, eval=T}
cg.n<-reproscir::cagr( tail(drake::readd(merged.data),50))
reproscir::set[1*((1.+ cg.n/100)^x)| x <- 1:30, x ]
```
following the approach suggetsed by [Konrad Rudolph](https://gist.github.com/klmr/35a13344080e71bf8c34)
